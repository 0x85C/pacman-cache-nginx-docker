# Similar to /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist, but YOU MUST REMOVE ".../$repo/os/$arch"
# from the end of the URLs

# The first mirror will always be used, the remaining mirrors will act as a
# backup if the first is not available, in a round-robin fashion

# THIS IS A SAMPLE LIST, YOU SHOULD CHANGE THIS TO YOUR PREFERENCE/REGION/AVAILABILITY
